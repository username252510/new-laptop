    <h1>Why I Should Get a Macbook for Christmas</h1>

    <img src="images/macbook1.webp" alt="Macbook Image">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a short website that explains why I think that I should get a Macbook, and not just because I want something new, but because I actually need something reliable that can keep up with school and everyday life. The laptop I use now is reaching its limits. It’s slow, heavy, and doesn’t handle schoolwork very well anymore. I've done my research, and coded this website myself in HTML so please just take a minute to read it and consider it.</p>

    <h2>Why I Need a New Laptop</h2>
    <p>I use my laptop for school every day, not just for Google Drive or searching, but also for using more advanced software when needed, which my laptop often struggles to run. Although my current laptop might have been good enough for me in the past, it is starting to become obsolete.</p>

    <h1>Reasons for an Upgrade</h1>

    <h2>Windows 10 End of Support</h2>
    <p>As you know, Microsoft ended support for Windows 10 in October. Luckily they have allowed users to enroll their devices to get security updates for another year, but sooner than later you're going to have to update to Windows 11. But the thing is my laptop doesn't even meet the minimum system requirements for Windows 11. This means it will no longer receive important security updates and bug fixes, which makes it less safe and less compatible with school software. Macbooks are also known to get years of updates, 7 years, plus a few security only updates after to be exact. </p>

    <h2>Bad Battery</h2>
    <p>My laptop battery isn't the best, meaning that I often find myself needing to search for outlets just to charge it, which lets face it a school built in the 1960's doesnt have much of. But if I got a Macbook, which are designed to have long lasting battery lives (up to 24 hours), this wouldnt be such of an issue, and I could charge it when it works for me instead of constantly having it plugged in.</p>

    <h2>Difficult to Carry Around</h2>
    <p>This is a less signifiagnt issue, but my current laptop is really bulky and heavy, and just putting it in my backpack doubles it in weight. Macbooks on the other hand are known to be light and compact, which is perfect for carrying it around throughout the day.</p>

    <h2>Slow and Underpowered</h2>
    <p>My current laptop lags when I have too many tabs open, and it especially struggles when using software like Adobe Illustrator and Premiere Pro, and one software (Autodesk Fusion) even said that my computer doesn't meet the recommended system requirements, so it doesn't run that well. A Macbook would allow be to browse the web and use advanced softwares seamlessly, due to how well optimized and powerful they are.</p>

    <h1>Responding to Concerns</h1>

    <h2>"Don’t you already have a perfectly good laptop?"</h2>
    <p>Yes, and I am grateful for it. But it is starting to become obsolete, it is underpowered for lots of more demanding tasks, and soon wont even get important security updates.</p>

    <h2>"Is this really a need or just a want?"</h2>
    <p>It is both. Yes, I do want a Macbook, but I also need something that performs better and fits my day to day life at school.</p>

    <h2>"So then what do we do with your old laptop?"</h2>
    <p>I actually have a great idea for that. I could repurpose my current laptop to self-host projects like a Minecraft server for me and my friends. That way it doesn't just sit there unused, and gives me a chance to learn more about tech.</p>
